        <center><h1>Cognitive Training </h1></center>
        <center><h4>Psychologists in Italy have designed cognitive exercises for training different abilities of the mind,<BR> such as attention, memory, abstraction and logic. For example, this can be important for persons having a temporary <BR> and reversible cognitive impairment and for all people who are motivated to train and to improve some cognitive capabilities.<BR>The idea is that these exercises can be implemented in a web application, where the user can regularly perform the exercises <BR> and on demand receive feedback of his or her progress. The exercises should be dynamic in the way that if results are improving,<BR>  difficulty of the exercises will increase and the other way around. It should be possible to share results with other users, <BR> such as a therapist or a friend (in order to introduce a competitive element).</h4>
